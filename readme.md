# MASS-Survey

MASS-Survey (Multi-Agent Scientific Survey) is an automated literature survey generation tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to produce comprehensive scientific literature surveys.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of our NLPCC 2024 paper: "Generation of Scientific Literature Surveys Based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)". The system utilizes a pipeline approach to automatically generate literature surveys through multiple processing stages.

## Pipeline Architecture

The system operates through six sequential stages:

1. **Extract Stage** (`extract.py`)
   - Processes JSON input files
   - Extracts and structures reference information
   - Generates structured bibliography data

2. **Structure Stage** (`chapterContent.py`)
   - Transforms bibliography data into structured chapter content
   - Implements initial content organization
   - Prepares framework for survey generation

3. **Title Stage** (`title&abstract.py`)
   - Generates chapter titles and abstracts
   - Ensures logical document structure
   - Creates content overview

4. **Content Stage** (`content.py`)
   - Produces detailed chapter content
   - Expands on structured framework
   - Implements in-depth analysis

5. **Conclusion Stage** (`Conclusion.py`)
   - Synthesizes overall findings
   - Generates comprehensive conclusions
   - Summarizes key contributions

6. **Integration Stage** (`integrator.py`)
   - Merges all components
   - Ensures document coherence
   - Produces final survey output

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/may3rr/MASS-Survey.git
cd MASS-Survey
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Configure your API settings in `config.py`:
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
API_BASE = 'your-api-base-url'
```

2. Prepare your input JSON files in the designated directory.

3. Run the pipeline sequentially:
```bash
python extract.py
python chapterContent.py
python "title&abstract.py"
python content.py
python Conclusion.py
python integrator.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages:
  - openai

abstract="With the rapid increase in the number and speed of scientific publications, researchers face significant time pressure when conducting literature reviews. This paper presents an automatic literature review generation method leveraging large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems (MAS). By designing multiple agent roles, including reference parsing, analysis, generation, and integration agents-this method fully utilizes the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs and the collaborative strengths of MAS to produce high-quality literature reviews. In the NLPCC2024 evaluation task, our method excelled in multiple automatic evaluation metrics (such as SoftHeadingRecall and ROUGE) and manual evaluations, showcasing its great potential for practical applications.",
