To our best knowledge,\nthe results for cases (i) and (ii) are the first results in the literature on\ncomplete convergence for sequences of $m$-pairwise negatively dependent random\nvariables and $m$-extended negatively dependent random variables under the\noptimal moment conditions even when $m=1$.

To\nmanage the data at this increased rate, we require new tools.

Rather than automating out human\ninteraction, YSE-PZ focuses on accelerating and enhancing human decision\nmaking, a role we describe as empowering the human-in-the-loop. Finally, YSE-PZ\nis built to be flexibly used and deployed; YSE-PZ can support multiple,\nsimultaneous, and independent transient collaborations through group-level data\npermissions, allowing a user to view the data associated with the union of all\ngroups in which they are a member.

In this paper, we propose a\nsimilar problem (which we call the shuffle variant of a Diophantine equation of\nMiyazaki and Togb\\'{e}). Here we first prove that the Diophantine equation\n$(2am+1)^x+(2m)^y=(2am-1)^z$ has only the solutions $(a, m, x, y, z)=(2, 1, 2,\n1, 3)$ and $(2,1,1,2,2)$ in positive integers $a&gt;1,m,x,y,z$. Then using this\nresult, we show that the Diophantine equation $b^x+2^y=(b-2)^z$ has only the\nsolutions $(b,x, y, z)=(5, 2, 1, 3)$ and $(5,1,2,2)$ in positive integers\n$x,y,z$ and $b$ odd."

This paper is an attempt to find numerical\nsolutions of Diophantine equations using steepest ascent version of Hill\nClimbing. The method, which uses tree representation to depict possible\nsolutions of Diophantine equations, adopts a novel methodology to generate\nsuccessors.

Subsequently the second\nauthor made the concrete conjecture that this cell decomposed space is the next\nbest thing to a polyhedron, by conjecturing it to be a regular CW complex that\nis homeomorphic to a closed ball. In this article we use discrete Morse theory\nto prove this conjecture up to homotopy-equivalence. Explicitly, we prove that\nthe boundaries of the cells are homotopic to spheres, and the closures of cells\nare contractible. The latter part generalizes a result of Lusztig's that\n(G/P)_{\\geq 0} -- the closure of the top-dimensional cell -- is contractible.\nConcerning our result on the boundaries of cells, even the special case that\nthe boundary of the top-dimensional cell (G/P)_{&gt; 0} is homotopic to a sphere,\nis new for all G/P other than projective space."

In the process of NC, the NR task explicitly\ntransfers several better network structures for the CD task, and the CD task\nexplicitly transfers a better community structure to assist the NR task.\nMoreover, to transfer knowledge from the NR task to the CD task, NC models the\nstudy of CD from dynamics to find communities in the dynamic network and then\nconsiders whether to transfer knowledge across tasks. A test suite for\nmultitasking NR and CD problems (MTNRCDPs) is designed to verify the\nperformance of NC. The experimental results conducted on the designed MTNRCDPs\nhave demonstrated that joint NR with CD has a synergistic effect, where the\nnetwork structure used to inform the existence of communities is also\ninherently employed to improve the reconstruction accuracy, which, in turn, can\nbetter demonstrate the discovering of the community structure.

The main tool for building public key encryption schemes in rank\nmetric is the McEliece encryption setting used with the family of Gabidulin\ncodes. Since the original scheme proposed in 1991 by Gabidulin, Paramonov and\nTretjakov, many systems have been proposed based on different masking\ntechniques for Gabidulin codes. Nevertheless, over the years all these systems\nwere attacked essentially by the use of an attack proposed by Overbeck.\n  In 2005 Faure and Loidreau designed a rank-metric encryption scheme which was\nnot in the McEliece setting. The scheme is very efficient, with small public\nkeys of size a few kiloBytes and with security closely related to the\nlinearized polynomial reconstruction problem which corresponds to the decoding\nproblem of Gabidulin codes. The structure of the scheme differs considerably\nfrom the classical McEliece setting and until our work, the scheme had never\nbeen attacked. We show in this article that this scheme like other schemes\nbased on Gabidulin codes, is also vulnerable to a polynomial-time attack that\nrecovers the private key by applying Overbeck's attack on an appropriate public\ncode. As an example we break concrete proposed $80$ bits security parameters in\na few seconds."

Such equations are important\nas they have many applications in fields like public key cryptography, integer\nfactorization, algebraic curves, projective curves and data dependency in super\ncomputers. Importantly, it has been proved that there is no general method to\nfind solutions of such equations. This paper is an attempt to find numerical\nsolutions of Diophantine equations using steepest ascent version of Hill\nClimbing. The method, which uses tree representation to depict possible\nsolutions of Diophantine equations, adopts a novel methodology to generate\nsuccessors. The heuristic function used help to make the process of finding\nsolution as a minimization process. The work illustrates the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methodology using a class of Diophantine equations given by a1. x1\np1 + a2. x2 p2 + ...... + an . xn pn = N where ai and N are integers. The\nexperimental results validate that the procedure proposed is successful in\nfinding solutions of Diophantine Equations with sufficiently large powers and\nlarge number of variables."

The analytic\ncalculation extends and revises Kuo's analysis of the mathematically similar\nbarotropic vorticity equation for incompressible neutral fluids on a rotating\nsphere [H.-L. Kuo, J. Meteor. $\\textbf{6}$, 105 (1949)]; then, the results are\napplied to the plasma case. An error in Kuo's original result is pointed out.\nAn explicit analytic formula for TI is derived and compared with numerical\ncalculations. It is shown that, within the generalized Hasegawa--Mima model, a\nsinusoidal ZF is TI-unstable if and only if it satisfies the Rayleigh--Kuo\ncriterion (known from geophysics) and that the ZF wave number exceeds the\ninverse ion sound radius. For non-sinusoidal ZFs, the results are qualitatively\nsimilar. As a corollary, there is no TI in the geometrical-optics limit, i.e.,\nwhen the perturbation wavelength is small compared to the ZF scale. This also\nmeans that the traditional wave kinetic equation, which is derived under the\ngeometrical-optics assumption, cannot adequately describe the ZF stability."
