Instead of dealing with a wide range of topics associated with the field, we focus on four essential topics of self-adaptation: design space for self-adaptive solutions, software engineering processes for self-adaptive systems, from centralized to decentralized control, and practical run-time verification & validation for self-adaptive systems. For each topic, we present an overview, suggest future directions, and focus on selected challenges. This paper complements and extends a previous roadmap on software engineering for self-adaptive systems published in 2009 covering a different set of topics, and reflecting in part on the previous paper. This roadmap is one of the many results of the Dagstuhl Seminar 10431 on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems, which took place in October 2010."

SBSE has been applied to problems throughout the Software Engineering lifecycle, from requirements and project planning to maintenance and re-engineering. The approach is attractive because it offers a suite of adaptive automated and semi-automated solutions in situations typified by large complex problem spaces with multiple competing and conflicting objectives. This paper provides a review and classification of literature on SBSE. The paper identifies research trends and relationships between the techniques applied and the applications to which they have been applied and highlights gaps in the literature and avenues for further research."

However, previous approaches have not handled requirement interactions, such as the dependencies that may exist between requirements, and, or, precedence, cost- and value-based constraints. To introduce and evaluate a Multi-Objective Search Based Requirements Selection technique, using chromosome repair and to evaluate it on both synthetic and real world data sets, in order to assess its effectiveness and scalability. The paper extends and improves upon our previous conference paper on requirements interaction management.1 The popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II was used to produce baseline data for each data set in order to determine how many solutions on the Pareto front fail to meet five different requirement interaction constraints. The results for this baseline data are compared to those obtained using the archive based approach previously studied and the repair based approach introduced in this paper. The repair based approach was found to produce more solutions on the Pareto front and better convergence and diversity of results than the previously studied NSGA-II and archive-based NSGA-II approaches based on Kruskal–Wallis test in most cases. The repair based approach was also found to scale almost as well as the previous approach. There is evidence to indicate that the repair based algorithm introduced in this paper is a suitable technique for extending previous work on requirements optimization to handle the requirement interaction constraints inherent in requirement interactions arising from dependencies, and, or, precedence, cost- and value-based constraints."

There has been a great deal of recent interest in search-based formulations of this problem in which module boundaries are identified by automated search, guided by a fitness function that captures the twin objectives of high cohesion and low coupling in a single-objective fitness function. This paper introduces two novel multi-objective formulations of the software module clustering problem, in which several different objectives (including cohesion and coupling) are represented separately. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-objective approach, a set of experiments was performed on 17 real-world module clustering problems. The results of this empirical study provide strong evidence to support the claim that the multi-objective approach produces significantly better solutions than the existing single-objective approach."

In this paper, we evaluate new and typical strategies to seed the initial population as well as to seed values introduced during the search when generating tests for object-oriented code. We report the results of a large empirical analysis carried out on 20 Java projects (for a total of 1,752 public classes). Our experiments show with strong statistical confidence that, even for a testing tool that is already able to achieve high coverage, the use of appropriate seeding strategies can further improve performance."

            "reference_abstract": "Object Constraint Language (OCL) constraints are typically used to provide precise semantics to models developed with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). When OCL constraints evolve regularly, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) and three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) to measure the understandability and maintainability of OCL constraints. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil&Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25 percent Complexity and 39 percent Coupling and improve 47.75 percent Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained positive results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment."

A precise\npositioning of new cars in the market is based on features and characteristics\ndescribed as requirements as well as on costs and profits. [Question/problem]\nHowever, introducing or changing requirements does not only impact the product\nand its parts, but may lead to overhead costs in the OEM due to increased\ncomplexity. The raised overhead costs may well exceed expected gains or costs\nfrom the changed requirements. [Principal ideas/results] By connecting\nrequirements with direct and overhead costs, decision making based on\nrequirements could become more valuable. [Contribution] This problem statement\nresults from a detailed examination of the effects of requirements management\npractices on process complexity and vice versa as well as on how today's\nrequirements management tools assist in this respect.

Such static code defect\npredictors perform well compared to manual methods, and they are easy to use\nand useful to use. But one of the \"black art\" of data mining is setting the\ntunings that control the miner. Objective:We seek simple, automatic, and very\neffective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with\ndifferent data sets (from open source JAVA systems), we ran differential\nevolution as anoptimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then\ntested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior\nexpectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required\ntens, not thousands,of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when\nlearning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tuningsthat\nalter detection precision from 0% to 60%. Conclusion: Since (1) the\nimprovements are so large, and (2) the tuning is so simple, we need to change\nstandard methods insoftware analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no\nlonger enough to just run a data miner and present the resultwithoutconducting\na tuning optimization study.

In such\ncontext, the goal is to optimize the Quality of Service (QoS) and cost\nobjectives for the cloud-based services. However, the difficulty lies in the\nfacts that these objectives, e.g., throughput and cost, can be naturally\nconflicted, and the QoS of cloud-based services often interfere due to the\nshared infrastructure in cloud. Consequently, dynamic and effective trade-off\ndecision making of autoscaling in the cloud is necessary, yet challenging. In\nparticular, it is even harder to achieve well-compromised trade-offs, where the\ndecision largely improves the majority of the objectives, while causing\nrelatively small degradations to others. In this paper, we present a\nself-adaptive decision making approach for autoscaling in the cloud. It is\ncapable to adaptively produce autoscaling decisions that lead to\nwell-compromised trade-offs without heavy human intervention. We leverage on\nant colony inspired multi-objective optimization for searching and optimizing\nthe trade-offs decisions, the result is then filtered by compromise-dominance,\na mechanism that extracts the decisions with balanced improvements in the\ntrade-offs.

Amalgamating IoT with\ncloud computing potentially allows rapid application and service provisioning\nin an efficient, scalable and robust manner. However, interactions between\nvWSNs and PaaS are largely an unexplored area. Indeed, existing vWSN IaaS are\nnot yet ready for PaaS. This paper proposes a vWSN IaaS architecture which is\nready for interactions with PaaS. The proposed architecture is based on our\nprevious works and is rooted in the fundamental differences between traditional\nIaaS and vWSN IaaS. We built a prototype using Java Sunspot as the WSN tool kit\nand made early performance measurements."

To\ncorrectly use these functionalities, software applications must satisfy certain\ncorrectness policies, for instance policies about the order some API methods\ncan be invoked and about the values that can be used for the parameters. If\nthese policies are violated, applications may produce misbehaviors and failures\nat runtime. Although this problem is general, applications that incorrectly use\nAPI methods are more frequent in certain contexts. For instance, Android\nprovides a rich and rapidly evolving set of APIs that might be used incorrectly\nby app developers who often implement and publish faulty apps in the\nmarketplaces. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the novel notion of\nproactive library, which augments classic libraries with the capability of\nproactively detecting and healing misuses at run- time. Proactive libraries\nblend libraries with multiple proactive modules that collect data, check the\ncorrectness policies of the libraries, and heal executions as soon as the\nviolation of a correctness policy is detected. The proactive modules can be\nactivated or deactivated at runtime by the users and can be implemented without\nrequiring any change to the original library and any knowledge about the\napplications that may use the library. We evaluated proactive libraries in the\ncontext of the Android ecosystem. Results show that proactive libraries can\nautomati- cally overcome several problems related to bad resource usage at the\ncost of a small overhead."
