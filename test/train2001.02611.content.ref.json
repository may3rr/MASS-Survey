However, with that increase there is also an increase in the security threats which affect the users’ privacy, identity and confidentiality. Different research groups highlighted the security threats in SN and attempted to offer some solutions to these issues. In this paper we survey several examples of this research and highlight the approaches. All the models we surveyed were focusing on protecting users’ information yet they failed to cover other important issues. For example, none of the mechanisms provided the users with control over what others can reveal about them; and encryption of images is still not achieved properly. Generally having higher security measures will affect the system’s performance in terms of speed and response time. However, this trade-off was not discussed or addressed in any of the models we surveyed."

The goal of this article is to provide an overview of online social networks in order to contribute to a better understanding of this worldwide phenomenon. In this context, we address for example the following questions: What are the major functionalities and characteristics of online social networks? What are the users’ motives for using them and how did online social networks emerge and develop over time? What is the impact and value of online social networks from a business perspective and what are corresponding challenges and risks?"

In this perspective, our work proposes a taxonomy-based approach to describe and model the complex security space characterising OSNs. The contributions of this paper are: 1) to introduce a systematic approach to define the ‘problem space’ of an OSN; 2) to showcase basic models for organising the engineering and the needed checking procedures."

Moreover, advances in Web technologies coupled with social networks has enabled users to not only access, but also generate, content in many forms. The overwhelming amount of produced content and resulting network traffic gives rise to precarious scalability issues for social networks, such as handling a large number of users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, and data storage. There are few surveys conducted to explore the different dimensions of social networks, such as security, privacy, and data acquisition. Most of the surveys focus on privacy or security-related issues and do not specifically address scalability challenges faced by social networks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study of social networks along with their significant characteristics and categorize social network architectures into three broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) hybrid. We also highlight various scalability issues faced by social network architectures. Finally, a qualitative comparison of presented architectures is provided, which is based on various scalability metrics, such as availability, latency, interserver communication, cost of resources, and energy consumption, just to name a few."

Built on a foundation of trust – users connect to other users with common interests or overlapping personal trajectories – online social networks and the associated applications extract an unprecedented volume of personal information. Unsurprisingly, serious privacy and security risks emerged, positioning themselves along two main types of attacks: attacks that exploit the implicit trust embedded in declared social relationships; and attacks that harvest user’s personal information for ill-intended use. This article provides an overview of the privacy and security issues that emerged so far in OSNs. We introduce a taxonomy of privacy and security attacks in OSNs, we overview existing solutions to mitigate those attacks, and outline challenges still to overcome."

Launched at the national level in 2014, the system’s aim is to assess the trustworthiness of Chinese citizens in keeping their promises and complying with legal rules, moral norms, and professional and ethical standards. It is essentially a collaborative project between the authorities and the business sectors to rate both individuals and other entities. In certain contexts, each individual will be given a social credit score or rank. Despite the claimed good will to curb escalating dishonesty across societal sectors in China, the worry is that the totality of individuals’ lives will be captured, that citizens will be monitored and that the Orwellian state will become a reality. Individuals risk being reduced to transparent selves before the state in this uneven battle. They are uncertain about what contributes to their social credit scores, how those scores are combined with the state system, and how their data is interpreted and used. In short, the big data-driven SCS is confronting Chinese citizens with major challenges to their privacy and personal data, amongst other interests critical to them. \r\nThis article first maps out the background to the construction of China’s big data social laboratory and the SCS, and then summarises the legislative history and evolving concept of social credit. It stresses that apart from the conspicuous SCS policy document introduced by the Chinese central government, pilot legislation has already been implemented at the local levels to regulate the collection and processing of social credit data. The third part critically reviews such local legislation (which often uses the term ‘public credit information’) with reference to personal data protection principles. It also highlights the restrictions on the data subjects’ rights that are placed by the uncoordinated legal framework of personal data and the extra-legal regime of personal archive. It argues that existing legislation and proposed regulations require substantial revisions to mitigate the impacts of the SCS on data privacy. This article hopes to lay the groundwork for further legal study related to social credit and big data in China."

While user (near) realtime geographical information is essential to enable location-based social discovery in LBSNs, the importance of user location privacy has also been recognized by leading real-world LBSNs. To protect user's exact geographical location from being exposed, a number of location protection approaches have been adopted by the industry so that only relative location information are publicly disclosed. These techniques are assumed to be secure and are exercised on the daily base. In this paper, we question the safety of these location-obfuscation techniques used by existing LBSNs. We show, for the first time, through real world attacks that they can all be easily destroyed by an attacker with the capability of no more than a regular LBSN user. In particular, by manipulating location information fed to LBSN client app, an ill-intended regular user can easily deduce the exact location information by running LBSN apps as location oracle and performing a series of attacking strategies. We develop an automated user location tracking system and test it on the most popular LBSNs including Wechat, Skout and Momo. We demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency via a 3 week real-world experiment with 30 volunteers. Our evaluation results show that we could geo-locate a target with high accuracy and can readily recover users' Top 5 locations. We also propose to use grid reference system and location classification to mitigate the attacks. Our work shows that the current industrial best practices on user location privacy protection are completely broken, and it is critical to address this immediate threat."

In contrast to centralized OSNs, a distributed online social network helps to lower the cost of the provider drastically, and allows better control of user privacy. This has several consequences: in terms of privacy, no central data collection, nor any central entity that decides or changes the terms of service. In this paper we focus on the definition of P2P Distributed Online Social Network (DOSN) paradigm and propose a new approach to P2P DOSN based on Dunbar's number, which bounds the number of people one knows and keeps social contacts with."

A common approach to build a DOSN is to use a peer-to-peer architecture. While the absence of a single point of data aggregation strikes the most powerful attacker from the list of adversaries, the decentralisation also removes some privacy protection afforded by the central party's intermediation of all communication. As content storage, access right management, retrieval and other administrative tasks of the service become the obligation of the users, it is non-trivial to hide the metadata of objects and information flows, even when the content itself is encrypted. Such metadata is, deliberately or as a side effect, hidden by the provider in a centralised system. In this work, we aim to identify the dangers arising or made more severe from decentralisation, and show how inferences from metadata might invade users' privacy. Furthermore, we discuss general techniques to mitigate or solve the identified issues."

The main source of the security problems is the central service provider that observes users' data and relationships. Distributed OSN (DOSN) is an alternative approach where users control their data without having any central service provider. In DOSNs, for the sake of data availability, users replicate or cache data in other users of the OSN. The replica nodes are indeed another kind of service provider in a small scale and with a local view. Therefore, even though decentralization removes the global view of the single provider, it results in having several small ones. By this claim, centralized and distributed OSNs have several common security concerns. Although there exist prior studies discussing and classifying security issues, a fine grained classification of various state-of-the-art solutions is not available. In this paper, we focus on the data privacy, data integrity, and secure social search solutions for centralized and distributed OSNs.

However, these new architectures have motivated researchers to investigate new privacy solutions that allow DOSN’s users to protect their contents by taking into account the decentralized nature of the DOSNs platform. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the privacy solutions adopted by currently available DOSNs, and we compare them by exploiting several criteria. After presenting the differences that existing DOSNs present in terms of provided services and architecture, we identify, for each of them, the privacy model used to define the privacy policies and the mechanisms for their management (i.e., initialization and modification of the privacy policy). In addition, we evaluate the overhead introduced by the security mechanisms adopted for privacy policy management and enforcement by discussing their advantages and drawbacks."

In the context of modern pervasive environments, which are characterized by complexity, heterogeneity, dynamicity, and mobility in terms of the underlying networks, the utilization of P2P overlays accordingly offers a series of advantages by countering the aforementioned adverse characteristics. The widespread deployment of pervasive environments and the plethora of proposed P2P systems, both call for a systematic way to study related research works. In this paper we review related research on P2P (peer-to-peer) overlay networks in pervasive environments. In this respect, we therefore analyze relevant requirements and discuss the application and deployment of P2P overlays and systems on top of the networking infrastructures that are supported by pervasive environments. Aspects such as scalability, resource discovery, algorithmic complexity, security, and support for dynamicity are examined for existing research works, in an effort to identify the most suitable P2P overlay for the requirements set by the nature of pervasive environments. We also taxonomize P2P overlays using the well-established classification scheme in regard to their structure or lack of it. Furthermore, we study the notions of multi-layer and bio-inspired P2P overlays that have great synergies with pervasive environments due to their inherent characteristics, especially in terms of flexibility and robustness. By describing and critically analyzing existing systems and discussing current research and open issues, we aim to instigate further research in this domain, while at the same time this work should serve as a point of reference for state-of-the-art P2P overlays in pervasive environments."

Several aspects of our mechanism are novel. First, the\nmechanism allows a transaction to access objects directly without regard to the\nlocation of the object. Second, processes running on behalf of a single\ntransaction may be located at many sites. Thus there is no need to invoke a new\ntransaction to perform processing or access objects at a remote site. Third,\nunlike other environments, LOCUS allows replication of data objects at more\nthan one site in the network, and this capability is incorporated into the\ntransaction mechanism. If the copy of an object that is currently being\naccessed becomes unavailable, it is possible to continue work by using another\none of the replicated copies. Finally, an efficient orphan removal algorithm is\npresented, and the problem of providing continued operation during network\npartitions is addressed in detail."

In this paper, we attempt to provide a t axonomy of structured P2P overlay networks security attacks. W e have specially focused on the way these attacks can arise at each level of the network. Moreover, we observed that most of the exi sting systems such as Content Addressable Network (CAN), Chord, Pastry, Tapestry, Kademlia, and Viceroy suffer from threats and vulnerability which lead to disrupt and corrupt their functioning . We hope that our survey constitutes a good help for who's working on this area of research. Keywords—P2P, Structured P2P Overlay Networks, DHT, Security, classification I. INTRODUCTION 2P networks systems have generated substantial inte rest in the last few years because the emergent of global s cale phenomena. As more and more users own powerful processors, large storage spaces and fast network c onnections, P2P networks represent an attractive way to mobiliz e these resources. They were designed to provide many services such as creating large scale data sharing, distributed c omputing, instant messages communication, collaborative appli cations, multi players games, and ad-hoc network. These popular services make P2P networks an attractive target for attackers. Knowing how systems have failed can help us build systems that resist failure (1). This paper collects and or ganizes a number of current security attacks that have caused failure in structured P2P overlay networks, so computer system designer, programmers, administrators, and users ma y do their work with a precise knowledge of what has gone before. Based on the overlay topology and the organization of the network connection different types of P2P networks have been defined as hierarchical P2P network, and flat P2P n etwork. In this paper, we will focus on hierarchical P2P netwo rk, more precisely on structured P2P overlay networks. Security attacks of structured P2P overlay network are any condition or circumstance that can threaten the bes t functioning of the system. To evaluate these attacks, an analyst must do a dee ply research, understand the system fluently, and recog nize that attacks may exist anywhere in the system."

In Sybil attack, a single malicious user forges multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct physical node in the system. However, Sybil attack is one of the most dangerous attacks that plague current structured Peer-to-Peer overlay networks. This attack is employed to target honest peers and hence subvert the system. In this paper, we describe a new methodology to analyze, detect, and mitigate Sybil attacks. We examine in detail this attack, the most challenging problem that currently propagates in structured Peer-to-Peer overlay networks. We identify features and search for behavioral attributes that may serve to identify such attacks. We were able to analyze them in depth, using honey pots, which allows us to collect information to distinguish Sybil nodes from honest nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a mitigation strategy that alleviates some of the effects of such an attack by injecting some commands into the Sybil node or subvert the communication channel."

While the distributed design of P2P provides inherent fault tolerance to certain failures, the large-scale decentralized coordination exhibits various exploitable security threats. One of these key threats are Eclipse attacks, where a large fraction of malicious peers can surround, i.e., eclipse benign peers. Topology-aware localized Eclipse attacks (taLEAs) are a new class of such attacks that allows for highly efficient denial of service attacks with a small amount of malicious resources. Our contribution is twofold: First, we show the generic susceptibility of structured P2P protocols to taLEAs. Second, we propose a new lookup mechanism for the proactive and reactive detection and mitigation of such attacks. Our novel lookup mechanism complements the common deterministic lookup with randomized decisions in order to reduce the predictability of the lookup. We validate our proposed technique via extensive simulations, increasing the lookup success to 100% in many scenarios."

Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms—such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis—to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now significantly impact a firm's reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don’t understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are defined by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how firms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities."

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people."

The subreddit\nr/unpopularopinion has been designed to allow users to share and discuss\nsocially unpopular thought frankly. In this study, we introduce a descriptive\nstudy to show how the subreddit r/unpopularopinion helps its users to get over\nthe spiral of silence. The r/unpopularopinion was analyzed based on the\nfindings from community observation and participant interviews. Even though the\nenvironment of r/unpopularopinion encourages the users to freely express their\nopinion, the dominant population of this community is young white males, and\nthe opinions representing their group are supported by general users and come\nup to the front page. Consequently, the minority opinions are neglected, and it\nresults in another spiral of silence phenomenon. In future research,"

The role of the State is also important in this matter, because State laws, community practices and governance also modify the pattern of access of its citizens to the networks.

For example, this problem can affect content publishing, creation of friendships, messaging, profile browsing, and commenting. Moreover, fake identities are often created to disseminate spam, use the private information of other users, commit fraud, and so on. A malicious person can generate numerous fake accounts for these purposes to reach a large number of trustworthy users. Thus, these types of malicious accounts must be detected and deactivated as quickly as possible. However, this objective is challenging, because a fake account can exhibit trustworthy behaviors and have a type of name that will prevent it from being detected by the security system. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of literature from 2006 to 2016 on Sybil attacks in online social networks and use of social networks as a tool to analyze and prevent these attack types. We first review existing Sybil attack definitions, including those in the context of online social networks. We then discuss a new taxonomy of Sybil attack defense schemes and methodologies. Finally, we compare the literature and identify areas for further research in Sybil attacks in online social networks."

This centralized nature of OSNs has several drawbacks including scalability, privacy, dependence on a provider, need for being online for every transaction, and a lack of locality. There have thus been several efforts toward decentralizing OSNs while retaining the functionalities offered by centralized OSNs. A decentralized online social network (DOSN) is a distributed system for social networking with no or limited dependency on any dedicated central infrastructure. In this chapter we explore the various motivations of a decentralized approach to online social networking, discuss several concrete proposals and types of DOSN as well as challenges and opportunities associated with decentralization."

Yet they have some limitations that we want to overcome for a next generation of social networks: privacy concerns and requirements of Internet connectivity, both of which are due to web-based applications on a central site whose owner has access to all data. To overcome these limitations, we envision a paradigm shift from client-server to a peer-to-peer infrastructure coupled with encryption so that users keep control of their data and can use the social network also locally, without Internet access. This shift gives rise to many research questions intersecting networking, security, distributed systems and social network analysis, leading to a better understanding of how technology can support social interactions. This paper is an attempt to identify the core functionalities necessary to build social networking applications and services, and the research challenges in realizing them in a decentralized setting. In the tradition of research-path defining papers in the peer-to-peer community, we highlight some challenges and opportunities for peer-to-peer in the era of social networks.

In this paper, we address the challenges that arise in implementing reliably and conveniently to use distributed data structures, such as lists or sets, in such a distributed hash-table-based online social network. We present a secure, distributed list data structure that manages the list entries in several buckets in the distributed hash table.

The approach for secure distributed lists is also applied for prefix trees and sets, and implemented and evaluated in a peer-to-peer framework for social networks.

Content distribution applications typically allow personal computers to function in a coordinated manner as a distributed storage medium by contributing, searching, and obtaining digital content.In this survey, we propose a framework for analyzing peer-to-peer content distribution technologies.

Each Pastry node keeps track of its immediate neighbors in the nodeId space, and notifies applications of new node arrivals, node failures and recoveries.

Project JXTA is looking ahead where billion of network services, all addressable on the network will be able to discover and interact with each other in an ad doc and decentralized manner through the formation of a multitude of virtual networks. The following paper describes the Project JXTA 2.0 implementation that was recently released by the JXTA community. The JXTA 2.0 implementation introduces a number of new features for improving overall functionality, performance, and scalability of the JXTA network. The JXTA 2.0 release is making a stronger differentiation in the way JXTA super-peers (relay and rendezvous) behave and interact with edge peers. The JXTA 2.0 implementation introduces the concept of a rendezvous peer view to connect rendezvous within a peergroup. Resolver queries are no more propagated to edge peers as in JXTA 1.0 reducing overall network traffic. Edge peers use a loosely-coupled distributed hash index to locate advertisements on the rendezvous peer view for efficient query lookups. The JXTA 2.0 implementation provides better resource management (threads and queues), and implements resource usage limits to fairly allocate resource between platform services. The JXTA 2.0 release also introduces new implementations of the TCP/IP and HTTP transports. The TCP/IP transport now takes advantage of bi-directional physical connections to limit the number of connections. Finally, the JXTA 2.0 implementation supports TCP/IP relay for efficient traversal of NATs."

Our results show that for groups of size 32 or more, our protocol has lower link stress (by about 25%), improved or similar end-to-end latencies and similar failure recovery properties. More importantly, it is able to achieve these results by using orders of magnitude lower control traffic.Finally, we present results from our wide-area testbed in which we experimented with 32-100 member groups distributed over 8 different sites. In our experiments, average group members established and maintained low-latency paths and incurred a maximum packet loss rate of less than 1% as members randomly joined and left the multicast group. The average control overhead during our experiments was less than 1 Kbps for groups of size 100."

In HIERAS, multiple P2P rings are generated in different layers. Each P2P ring only contains a subset of the system nodes. These rings are created in such a strategy that the average link latency between two peers in lower level rings is much smaller than in higher level rings. Routing tasks are first executed in lower level rings before they go up to the higher level rings, a large portion of routing hops previously executed in the global P2P ring are now replaced by the hops in lower level rings, thus routing overhead is greatly reduced."

Unstructured overlays, like Gnutella, build a random graph and use flooding or random walks on the graph to discover data stored by overlay nodes. Structured overlays assign keys to data items and build a graph that maps each key to a specific node. The structure of the graph enables efficient discovery of data items given their keys but it does not support complex queries.Should we build Gnutella on a structured overlay? We believe the answer is yes. We replaced the random graph in Gnutella by a structured overlay while retaining the content placement and discovery mechanisms of unstructured overlays to support complex queries. Our preliminary results indicate that we can use structure to improve the performance of floods and rondom walks. They also indicate that structure can be used to reduce maintenance overhead, which is surprising because it is commonly believed that unstructured overlays have lower maintenance overhead than structured overlays."

The proposed approach features a fully distributed ant-inspired self-organized overlay construction that maintains a bounded diameter overlay, and a selective flooding-based discovery algorithm that exploits local caches to reduce the number of visited nodes. To improve the caching scheme while retaining minimal bandwidth consumption, cache contents are periodically exchanged between neighboring nodes using an epidemic replication mechanism that is based on a gossiping algorithm, thus allowing nodes to have a more general view of the network and its resources. Extensive experimentation provides evidence that the average number of hops required to efficiently locate resources is limited and that our framework performs well with respect to hit rate and network overhead."

As opposed to the structured P2P systems deployed so far, resource indexing and placement is uncorrelated with network structure and topology, and resource keys are organized and managed by self-organizing mobile agents through simple local operations driven by probabilistic choices. Self-Chord has three main features that are particularly advantageous in Grid and Cloud Computing: 1) it is possible to give a semantic meaning to keys, which enables the execution of range queries; 2) the keys are fairly distributed over the peers, thus improving the balancing of storage responsibilities; 3) maintenance load is also limited because it is not necessary to reassign keys when new peers or resources are added to the system-the mobile agents will spontaneously reorganize the keys.

The algorithm is inspired by Ant Colony Optimisation in regards to the network exploration and neighborhood optimisation. By utilising different ant families, multiple overlay layers, each one optimised for a different property, can be concurrently maintained at a low cost as proven by our experimental results.

The proposed algorithm has been designed with an aim towards providing an efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) file search in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). With reference to Li et al. (2004) and Gerla and Lindemann (2005) it has been observed that the implementation of P2P file sharing system on MANETs is quite tricky to implement as compared to that on a wired network. With the advent of swarm intelligence, the P2P file sharing methodology not only found an optimized search process involving a more selective node tracing, but it also proved to improve the time efficiency and robustness of the sharing mechanism. The P2P file searching system implementation, particularly in a network of mobile nodes, poses: (a) the percentage network area scanned and (b) the selective file retrieval from a set of file bearing nodes as the biggest challenges. Managing nodes scattered over a large terrain is not easy. Node connectivity and file information become more volatile as the network area increases. Probability of retrieving a file from a profitable source is also a yardstick to determine how good the file retrieval algorithm is. This algorithm referred to as P2PBA implements the P2P file searching process using the bee algorithm (Pham et al., 2006b, Wedde and Farooq, 2005) and aims at solving these two challenges. This scheme of swarm-based intelligence, which is based on the foraging behavior of honey bees, optimizes the search process selectively hunting for more promising honey sources and scans a sizeable area in a more comprehensive manner. Following a description of the proposed algorithm, this paper finally presents the simulation results for the network against various specified parameters. The simulation results show that our algorithm proposes to make file searching much more efficient and improves the statistics against the posed challenges."

The hypothesis of this work is that in order to achieve a resilient and adaptive peer-to-peer (P2P) network, each network node must proactively maintain a minimum number of edges. Specifically, low-level communication protocols are not sufficient by themselves to achieve high-service availability, especially in the case of ad hoc or dynamic networks with a high degree of node addition and deletion. The concept has been evaluated within a P2P agent application in which each agent has a goal to maintain a preferred number of connections to a number of service providing agents. Using this algorithm, the agents update a weight value associated with each connection, based on the perceived utility of the connection to the corresponding agent. This utility function can be a combination of several node or edge parameters, such as degree k of the target node, or frequency of the message response from the node. This weight is updated using a set of Hebbian-style learning rules, such that the network as a whole exhibits adaptive self-organizing behavior. The principal result is the finding that by limiting the connection neighborhood within the overlay topology, the resulting P2P network can be made highly resilient to targeted attacks on high-degree nodes, while maintaining search efficiency"

Recently, issues in overlay network have also been introduced into cloud systems, in order to organize thousands of virtualized resources.

When multiple applications running over a large set of nodes, some of nodes may take repeated efforts to preserve multi-overlay networks. Therefore, maintaining these co-existing overlays brings the redundant maintenance overhead. This paper presents a cooperative strategy to analyze the overlay maintenance of multi-overlay environments and to elaborate multiple overlays for simplifying the overlay maintenance. The proposed strategy exploits the synergy of co-existing overlays to handle their common overlay-maintenance, so that the redundant maintenance overhead could be eliminated while keeping performance. To evaluate the system performance, this paper not only analyzes several overlays but also considers realistic multi-overlay environments by varying the intersection ratio of diverse overlays and the combination of multiple overlays. Experimental results show that the proposed cooperative strategy significantly decreases the redundant overlay-maintenance overhead, where the reduction ratio of maintaining multiple overlays is higher than 60 percent in some of cases."

Mosaic uses runtime composition to simultaneously deliver application-aware mobility, NAT traversal and reliability. We further demonstrate Mosaic's dynamic composition capabilities by Chord switching its underlay from IP to RON at runtime.

To evaluate Geodemlia, a real world workload model for peer-to-peer location-based services is derived from traces of Twitter. Using the workload model, a system parameter analysis of Geodemlia is conducted with the goal of finding a suitable parameter configuration. In addition, the scalability and robustness of Geodemlia is compared to a state-of-the-art tree-based approach by investigating the performance and costs of both overlays under an increasing number of peers, an increasing radius of area searches, an increasing level of churn as well as for different peer placement and search request schemes. The evaluation results reveal that in contrast to the tree-based approach, Geodemlia provides on average a 46% better success ratio as well as a 18% better recall at a moderate higher traffic overhead of 13 bytes/s and an increased average response time of 0.2 s."

Each node in an overlay network maintains connections with a number of peers, forming a graph upon which a distributed application or service is implemented. In an “Eclipse” attack, a set of malicious, colluding overlay nodes arranges for a correct node to peer only with members of the coalition. If successful, the attacker can mediate most or all communication to and from the victim. Furthermore, by supplying biased neighbor information during normal overlay maintenance, a modest number of malicious nodes can eclipse a large number of correct victim nodes. This paper studies the impact of Eclipse attacks on structured overlays and shows the limitations of known defenses. We then present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new defense, in which nodes anonymously audit each other’s connectivity. The key observation is that a node that mounts an Eclipse attack must have a higher than average node degree. We show that enforcing a node degree limit by auditing is an effective defense against Eclipse attacks. Furthermore, unlike most existing defenses, our defense leaves flexibility in the selection of neighboring nodes, thus permitting important overlay optimizations like proximity neighbor selection (PNS)."

Despite their attractive features, these overlays remain vulnerable to the Identity attack, where malicious nodes assume control of application components by intercepting and hijacking key-based routing requests. Attackers can assume arbitrary application roles such as storage node for a given file, or return falsified contents of an online shopper's shopping cart. In this paper, we define a generalized form of the Identity attack, and propose a lightweight detection and tracking system that protects applications by redirecting traffic away from attackers. We describe how this attack can be amplified by a Sybil or Eclipse attack, and analyze the costs of performing such an attack. Finally, we present measurements of a deployed overlay that show our techniques to be significantly more lightweight than prior techniques, and highly effective at detecting and avoiding both single node and colluding attacks under a variety of conditions."

            "reference_abstract": "The dynamics of peer participation, or churn, are an inherent property of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems and critical for design and evaluation. Accurately characterizing churn requires precise and unbiased information about the arrival and departure of peers, which is challenging to acquire. Prior studies show that peer participation is highly dynamic but with conflicting characteristics. Therefore, churn remains poorly understood, despite its significance.In this paper, we identify several common pitfalls that lead to measurement error. We carefully address these difficulties and present a detailed study using three widely-deployed P2P systems: an unstructured file-sharing system (Gnutella), a content-distribution system (BitTorrent), and a Distributed Hash Table (Kad). Our analysis reveals several properties of churn: (i) overall dynamics are surprisingly similar across different systems, (ii) session lengths are not exponential, (iii) a large portion of active peers are highly stable while the remaining peers turn over quickly, and (iv) peer session lengths across consecutive appearances are correlated. In summary, this paper advances our understanding of churn by improving accuracy, comparing different P2P file sharingdistribution systems, and exploring new aspects of churn."

In practice, such systems have two disadvantages: They provide no control over where data is stored and no guarantee that routing paths remain within an administrative domain whenever possible. SkipNet is a scalable overlay network that provides controlled data placement and guaranteed routing locality by organizing data primarily by string names. SkipNet allows for both fine-grained and coarse-grained control over data placement: Content can be placed either on a pre-determined node or distributed uniformly across the nodes of a hierarchical naming sub-tree. An additional useful consequence of SkipNet's locality properties is that partition failures, in which an entire organization disconnects from the rest of the system, can result in two disjoint, but well-connected overlay networks."

Hence, the power consumption in networks\nis strongly related to the number of active network elements, such as\ninterfaces, line cards, base chassis,... The goal thus is to find a routing\nthat minimizes the (weighted) number of active network elements used when\nrouting. In this paper, we consider a simplified architecture where a\nconnection between two routers is represented as a link joining two network\ninterfaces. When a connection is not used, both network interfaces can be\nturned off. Therefore, in order to reduce power consumption, the goal is to\nfind the routing that minimizes the number of used links while satisfying all\nthe demands. We first define formally the problem and we model it as an integer\nlinear program. Then, we prove that this problem is not in APX, that is there\nis no polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm. We propose a\nheuristic algorithm for this problem and we also prove some negative results\nabout basic greedy and probabilistic algorithms. Thus we present a study on\nspecific topologies, such as trees, grids and complete graphs, that provide\nbounds and results useful for real topologies. We then exhibit the gain in\nterms of number of network interfaces (leading to a global reduction of\napproximately 33 MWh for a medium-sized backbone network) for a set of existing\nnetwork topologies: we see that for almost all topologies more than one third\nof the network interfaces can be spared for usual ranges of operation.

In order to establish the primary path, this algorithm uses\nload balancing in which link cost metrics are estimated based on the current\nload of the links. In backup path setup, the source calculates the blocking\nprobability through the received feedback from the destination by sending a\nsmall fraction of probe packets along the existing paths.

Subsequently, we give\na construction of nonlocal set of OPSs with smaller members in $\\mathbb{C}^{d}\n\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d}$ for $d\\geq3$. On the other hand, we present two\nconstruction methods of nonlocal sets of OPSs in $\\mathbb{C}^{m} \\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, where $m\\geq3$ and $n\\geq3.$ Furthermore, we propose the\nconcept of isomorphism for two nonlocal sets of OPSs. Our work is of great help\nto understand the structure and classification of locally indistinguishable\nOPSs."

In this case, a Transition of Control (ToC) is\nnecessary so that the driver takes control of the driving. Executing a ToC\nrequires the driver to get full situation awareness of the driving environment.\nIf the driver fails to get back the control in a limited time, a Minimum Risk\nManeuver (MRM) is executed to bring the vehicle into a safe state (e.g.,\ndecelerating to full stop).

Our\nsecond scheme is purely classical, yet it cannot be broken by a quantum\neavesdropper who is only willing to expend an effort proportional to that of\nthe legitimate parties.\n  We then introduce two families of more elaborate protocols. The first family\nconsists in quantum protocols whose security is arbitrarily close to quadratic\nin the query complexity model.

            "reference_abstract": "As the need for machine learning (ML) increases rapidly across all industry\nsectors, there is a significant interest among commercial database providers to\nsupport \"Query 2.0\", which integrates model inference into SQL queries.\nDebugging Query 2.0 is very challenging since an unexpected query result may be\ncaused by the bugs in training data (e.g., wrong labels, corrupted features).\nIn response, we propose Rain, a complaint-driven training data debugging\nsystem. Rain allows users to specify complaints over the query's intermediate\nor final output, and aims to return a minimum set of training examples so that\nif they were removed, the complaints would be resolved. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to study this problem. A naive solution requires\nretraining an exponential number of ML models. We propose two novel heuristic\napproaches based on influence functions which both require linear retraining\nsteps. We provide an in-depth analytical and empirical analysis of the two\napproaches and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate their effectiveness\nusing four real-world datasets. Results show that Rain achieves the highest\nrecall@k among all the baselines while still returns results interactively."

Moreover, the node gossips the event to its\n\"non-interested\" neighbours, so that the event can be spread through the\noverlay. A mathematical analysis is provided to estimate the number of nodes\nreceiving the event, based on the network topology, the amount of subscribers\nand the gossip probability. These outcomes are compared to those obtained via\nsimulation. Results show even when the amount of subscribers represents a very\nsmall (yet non-negligible) portion of network nodes, by tuning the gossip\nprobability the event can percolate through the overlay.

Currently, researchers try to combine peer-to-peer systems with\ncloud infrastructures. They developed monitoring and control architectures that\nuse resources from the cloud in order to enhance QoS and achieve an attractive\ntrade-off between stability and low cost operation. However, there is a lack of\nresearch effort on the congestion control of these systems and the existing\ncongestion control architectures are not suitable for P2P live streaming\ntraffic (small sequential non persistent traffic towards multiple network\nlocations). This paper proposes a P2P live streaming traffic aware congestion\ncontrol protocol that: i) is capable to manage sequential traffic heading to\nmultiple network destinations , ii) efficiently exploits the available\nbandwidth, iii) accurately measures the idle peer resources, iv) avoids network\ncongestion, and v) is friendly to traditional TCP generated traffic. The\nproposed P2P congestion control has been implemented, tested and evaluated\nthrough a series of real experiments powered across the BonFIRE infrastructure."

For network planners\nwho are deploying VoIP over WLANs, one of the important issues is the VoIP\ncapacity. VoIP bandwidth consumption over a WAN is one of the most important\nfactors to consider when building a VoIP infrastructure. Failure to account for\nVoIP bandwidth requirements will severely limit the reliability of a VoIP\nsystem and place a huge burden on the WAN infrastructure. Less bandwidth\nutilization is the key reasons for reduced number of channel accesses in VOIP.\nBut in the QoS point of view the free bandwidth of atleast 1-5% will improve\nthe voice quality. This proposal utilizes the maximum bandwidth by leaving 1-5%\nfree bandwidth.

At each time BDM will calculate the bandwidth utilization before\nsending the packet to improve performance and voice quality of VoIP. The\nbandwidth calculation in BDM can be done by using Erlang and VOIP bandwidth\ncalculator.
