While traditional acoustic processing applications have been developed taking into account high-throughput computing platforms equipped with expensive multichannel audio interfaces, the IoT paradigm is demanding the use of more flexible and energy-efficient systems. In this context, algorithms for source localization and ranging in wireless acoustic sensor networks can be considered an enabling technology for many IoT-based environments, including security, industrial, and health-care applications. This paper is aimed at evaluating important aspects dealing with the practical deployment of IoT systems for acoustic source localization. Recent systems-on-chip composed of low-power multicore processors, combined with a small graphics accelerator (or GPU), yield a notable increment of the computational capacity needed in intensive signal processing algorithms while partially retaining the appealing low power consumption of embedded systems. Different algorithms and implementations over several state-of-the-art platforms are discussed, analyzing important aspects, such as the tradeoffs between performance, energy efficiency, and exploitation of parallelism by taking into account real-time constraints."

For every inanimate object can tell us something by the sound it makes, acoustic sensor demonstrates great advantages comparing to conventional electronic and mechanic sensors in such cases: overcoming environmental obstacles, mapping to existing use cases of detecting problems with human ears, low cost for deployment, etc. It could be widely applied to various domains, such as predictive maintenance of machinery, robot sensory, elderly and baby care in smart home, etc. Whether we can use the acoustic sensor data to understand what is happening and to predict what will happen relies heavily on the analytics capabilities we apply to the acoustic data, which has to overcome the obstacles of noise, disturbance and errors, and has to meet the requirement of real-time processing of high volume signals with large number of sensors. In this paper, we propose a scalable cognitive acoustics analytics service for IoT that provides the user an incremental learning approach to evolve their analytics capability on non-intuitive and unstructured acoustic data through the combination of acoustic signal processing and machine learning technology. It first performs acoustic signal processing and denoising, enables acoustic signal based abnormal detection based on sound intensity, spectral centroid, etc. Then based on the accumulated abnormal data, a supervised learning method is performed as baseline and a neural network based classifier is used to recognize acoustic events in different scenarios with various volume of sample data and requirement of accuracy. In addition, acoustic sensor arrays processing is supported for localization of moving acoustic source in more complex scenario. In this paper, we designed a hybrid computing structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on acoustic event recognition for machinery diagnosis, and show that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy."

Given that such channels are audible to participants they are considered more resistant to active attacks, i.e., the attack signal would be heard by the participants. In this paper, we investigate the validity of this assumption using two prominent acoustic self-jamming systems implementations. We show that basic overshadowing attacks are possible in these systems and that these attacks cannot be effectively detected by the participants if the attacker is close to the receiving device. Finally, we propose a novel physical-layer solution for effectively detecting overshadowing attacks, which can improve state-of-the-art acoustic self-jamming systems by ensuring channel integrity while not requiring fundamental modifications to these schemes."

In our experiments, the attack recovers up to 72 % of printed words, and up to 95 % if we assume contextual knowledge about the text, with a microphone at a distance of 10cmfrom the printer. After an upfront training phase, the attack is fully automated and uses a combination of machine learning, audio processing, and speech recognition techniques, including spectrum features, Hidden Markov Models and linear classification; moreover, it allows for feedback-based incremental learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures, and we describe how we successfully mounted the attack in-field (with appropriate privacy protections) in a doctor's practice to recover the content of medical prescriptions."

In this paper, we present, DP-UTIL, a holistic utility\nanalysis framework of DP across the ML pipeline with focus on input\nperturbation, objective perturbation, gradient perturbation, output\nperturbation, and prediction perturbation. Given an ML task on\nprivacy-sensitive data, DP-UTIL enables a ML privacy practitioner perform\nholistic comparative analysis on the impact of DP in these five perturbation\nspots, measured in terms of model utility loss, privacy leakage, and the number\nof truly revealed training samples. We evaluate DP-UTIL over classification\ntasks on vision, medical, and financial datasets, using two representative\nlearning algorithms (logistic regression and deep neural network) against\nmembership inference attack as a case study attack. One of the highlights of\nour results is that prediction perturbation consistently achieves the lowest\nutility loss on all models across all datasets. In logistic regression models,\nobjective perturbation results in lowest privacy leakage compared to other\nperturbation techniques.

            "reference_abstract": "Voice control is a popular way to operate mobile devices, enabling users to communicate requests to their devices. However, adversaries can leverage voice control to trick mobile devices into executing commands to leak secrets or to modify critical information. Contemporary mobile operating systems fail to prevent such attacks because they do not control access to the speaker at all and fail to control when untrusted apps may use the microphone, enabling authorized apps to create exploitable communication channels. In this paper, we propose a security mechanism that tracks the creation of audio communication channels explicitly and controls the information flows over these channels to prevent several types of attacks.We design and implement AuDroid, an extension to the SELinux reference monitor integrated into the Android operating system for enforcing lattice security policies over the dynamically changing use of system audio resources. To enhance flexibility, when information flow errors are detected, the device owner, system apps and services are given the opportunity to resolve information flow errors using known methods, enabling AuDroid to run many configurations safely. We evaluate our approach on 17 widely-used apps that make extensive use of the microphone and speaker, finding that AuDroid prevents six types of attack scenarios on audio channels while permitting all 17 apps to run effectively. AuDroid shows that it is possible to prevent attacks using audio channels without compromising functionality or introducing significant performance overhead."

            "reference_abstract": "Edge computing is the concept of moving computation back to the endpoints of a network, as an alternative to, or in combination with, centralized, cloud-based architectures. It is especially of interest for Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems where embedded endpoints make up the edge of the network, and where these devices need to make localised, time-critical decisions. In these environment secure, ad-hoc device-to-device interaction is important, but offers a challenge because devices might belong to different systems, or security domains, which complicates trusted communication and key establishment. There has been a growing interest in complementing conventional cryptography with physical context. This allows for services that are difficult to achieve with existing cryptographic mechanisms: devices pairing (initial key establishment) and proof-of-proximity (ensuring devices are physically present). Numerous methods, the majority of which are based on the physical context of device characteristics, behavior or environment, have been proposed to supplement cryptography in achieving these services. This paper provides an overview of this area of research, first discussing the nature and importance of the two specified security services in ad-hoc communication settings and then providing an introduction to prominent physical context security approaches in literature."

These techniques are heavily used for improving security and usability in Zero-Interaction based Co-presence Detection and Authentication (ZICDA) systems. In particular, the survey includes a discussion on the possible adversary and communication models along with the existing security attacks on ZICDA systems, and it reviews the state-of-the-art proximity detection techniques that make use of contextual information. These proximity detection techniques are commonly referred to as Contextual Co-presence (COCO) protocols, which dynamically collect and use contextual information to improve the security of ZICDA systems during the proximity verification process. Finally, we summarize the significant challenges and suggest possible innovative and efficient future solutions for securely detecting co-presence between devices in the presence of adversaries. The proximity verification techniques presented in the literature usually involve trade-offs between metrics such as efficiency, security, deployment cost, and usability. At present, there is no ideal solution which adequately addresses the trade-off between these metrics. Therefore, we trust that this review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and pave the way for the design of future practical, secure, and efficient solutions."

Data transmission in public communication system is not secure because of interception and improper manipulation by eavesdropper. So the attractive solution for this problem is Steganography, which is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intend recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity. Audio steganography is the scheme of hiding the existence of secret information by concealing it into another medium such as audio file.

            "reference_abstract": "Abstract — Digital processing of speech signal and voice recognition algorithm is very important for fast and accurate automatic voice recognition technology. The voice is a signal of infinite information. A direct analysis and synthesizing the complex voice signal is due to too much information contained in the signal. Therefore the digital signal processes such as Feature Extraction and Feature Matching are introduced to represent the voice signal. Several methods such as Liner Predictive Predictive Coding (LPC), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and etc are evaluated with a view to identify a straight forward and effective method for voice signal. The extraction and matching process is implemented right after the Pre Processing or filtering signal is performed. The non-parametric method for modelling the human auditory perception system, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are utilize as extraction techniques. The non linear sequence alignment known as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) introduced by Sakoe Chiba has been used as features matching techniques. Since it’s obvious that the voice signal tends to have different temporal rate, the alignment is important to produce the better performance.This paper present the viability of MFCC to extract features and DTW to compare the test patterns."

In particular, we describe the effectiveness of Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as the feature for emotion recognition. We focus on the precise classification of MFCC feature vectors, rather than their dynamic nature over an utterance. To realize such an approach, the proposed algorithm employs multi-template emotion classification of the analysis frames. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed algorithm produces 66.4% recognition accuracy in speaker-independent emotion recognition experiments for four specific emotions. This recognition accuracy is higher than the accuracy obtained by the conventional prosody-based and MFCC-based emotion recognition algorithms, which confirms the potential of the proposed algorithm."

Random forests are an\nensemble learning method for classification and regression that constructs a\nnumber of randomized decision trees during the training phase and predicts by\naveraging the results. Since its publication in the seminal paper of Breiman\n(2001), the procedure has become a major data analysis tool, that performs well\nin practice in comparison with many standard methods. What has greatly\ncontributed to the popularity of forests is the fact that they can be applied\nto a wide range of prediction problems and have few parameters to tune.

The enforcement of stability is performed by\ndividing the unstable model into two different models, one composed by the\nstable poles (stable model) and the other composed by the unstable ones\n(unstable model). Then, the poles of the unstable state-space model are forced\nto be stable, leading to the computation of a stabilized state-space model.\nAfterwards, to make sure that the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the\nstabilized model well match the FRFs of the unstable model, the Least-Squares\nFrequency Domain (LSFD) method is exploited to update the modal parameters of\nthe stabilized model composed by the pairs of complex conjugate poles. The\nvalidity of the proposed methodologies is presented and discussed by exploiting\nexperimental data. Indeed, by exploiting the FRFs of a real system, accurate\nstate-space models respecting Newton's second law are computed. Then,\ndecoupling and coupling operations are performed with the identified\nstate-space models, no matter the models resultant from the decoupling/coupling\noperations are unstable.

Currently deployed two-factor authentication\nmechanisms require the user to interact with his phone to, for example, copy a\nverification code to the browser.

Sound-Proof does not require interaction between the\nuser and his phone. In Sound-Proof the second authentication factor is the\nproximity of the user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity\nof the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their\nmicrophones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so\nthat the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication.\nSound-Proof can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major\nbrowsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We\nprovide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to\ndetermine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if\nthe phone is in a pocket or purse.

However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized\nphysical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the\nattacker to have unfettered access to the terminal.\n  In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by\n(un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she\napproaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is\nbelieved to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the\ntoken to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session. While walking-based\nbiometrics schemes have been studied in prior literature for other application\nsettings, our main novelty lies in the careful use of: (1) multiple sensors\navailable on the current breed of devices (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer), and (2) multiple devices carried by the user (in particular, an\n\"in-pocket\" smartphone and a \"wrist-worn\" smartwatch), that all capture unique\nfacets of user's walking pattern.

Our system can detect\novershadowing attacks using a ternary decision function with a threshold. In\nour evaluation of this SDP scheme's security and robustness, we achieve a bit\nerror ratio below 0.1% for a net bit rate of 100 bps with a signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of 14 dB.

Since games are a popular means of entertainment, our hypothesis is\nthat they may serve as an incentive to users and make the pairing process\nenjoyable for them, thus improving the usability, as well as the security, of\nthe pairing process. We consider an emerging use case of pairing whereby two\ndifferent users are involved, each in possession of his or her own device\n(e.g., Alice and Bob pairing their smartphones for social interactions). We\ndevelop \"Alice Says,\" a pairing game based on a popular memory game called\nSimon (Says), and discuss the underlying design challenges.

Our results indicate that\noverall Alice Says was deemed as a fun and an enjoyable way to pair devices,\nconfirming our hypothesis.

A QR-PSM protocol is a PSM protocol whose\ndecoding function outputs the quadratic residuosity of what is computed from\nmessages. We design a QR-PSM protocol for any symmetric function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n\n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ of communication complexity $O(n^2)$.

We also study the\nsizes of the underlying finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_p$ in the protocols since the\ncommunication complexity of a QR-PSM protocol is proportional to the bit length\nof the prime $p$. In particular, we show that the $N$-th Peralta prime $P_N$,\nwhich is used for general QR-PSM protocols, can be taken as at most\n$(1+o(1))N^2 2^{2N-2}$, which improves the Peralta's known result (Mathematics\nof Computation 1992) by a constant factor $(1+\\sqrt{2})^2$."

However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced\nand has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of\nhidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS\nbut not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on\nwhite-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to\nspecific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic\nhardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we\nbreak these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through\nmodel-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal\nprocessing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into\nmachine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple\nsource audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic\nfeature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of\nperturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine\nlearning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing\nSpeech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful\nattacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously\ngenerated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating\neffectiveness across both models and real systems.

In this setting, we exploit machine\nlearning (ML) tools to design soft and hard decoding schemes by using precoded\npilot symbols as training data. In this context, we propose ML frameworks for\ndecoders that allow an Eve to determine the transmitted message with high\naccuracy. We thereby show that MU-MISO systems are vulnerable to such\neavesdropping attacks even when relatively secure transmission techniques are\nemployed, such as symbol-level precoding (SLP). To counteract this attack, we\npropose two novel SLP-based schemes that increase the bit-error rate at Eve by\nimpeding the learning process. We design these two security-enhanced schemes to\nmeet different requirements regarding complexity, security, and power\nconsumption. Simulation results validate both the ML-based eavesdropping\nattacks as well as the countermeasures, and show that the gain in security is\nachieved without affecting the decoding performance at the intended users."
